Stations can break which makes the ship sink faster. You need to repair them before it is too late.

Fulfill research missions to fill up your research storage
Interact with research storage Station to send gathered research to Earth where other scientists can use it to publish papers

For every 3 completed missions you get to choose an artifact, which can be a special ability, a helpful station, or a repair kit

Known Issues
you will be confused and overwhelmed when first playing the game
in the settings menu you need to have the tutorial button selected to be able to go down to the Next and Back buttons
sometimes you can get stuck in a wall
sometimes the research bar fills up again to a certain amount right after uploading data
sometimes when you get a new mission it is automatically completed without you having to do anything (not sure if that bug still exists, but it might)
when you have a controller connected some of the keyboard inputs don’t work
